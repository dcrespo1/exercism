# Exercism Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to programming exercises from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/).

## About

- Each folder represents a language track (e.g., `python`, `csharp`, `go`).
- Inside each track, youâ€™ll find my submitted iterations for various exercises.
- Solutions are synced automatically from Exercism using the official GitHub integration bot.

## Why Exercism?

Exercism is a free learning platform that helps improve programming skills through:
- Practice exercises
- Automated test suites
- Human mentorship
- Idiomatic patterns for dozens of languages

## Notes

- These are my personal learning exercises.
- Code here is not necessarily optimized for production, but represents my learning process.
- Feedback is welcome!
